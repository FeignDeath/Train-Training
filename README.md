# Welcome to Flatland

> Welcome to Kep's repository about research into ASP-focused solutions to the Flatland problem.

In this repository, you'll find three main areas:
1. Encodings
2. Course materials
3. Individual module

## Encodings
In this folder, you will find ongoing attempts and approaches at producing encodings to solve the Flatland problem.  These files are primarily the `.lp` files that pertain to the instances, solution encodings, and other related assets.

## Course materials
In this folder, you will find `.md` and PDF versions of assignments that were given to our student enrolled in the KRR-Flatland course during the summer semester.  These can be referred to for future iterations of the course.

## Individual module
In this folder, you will find materials that pertain to the IM portion of the researchâ€”this is primarily everything that comes prior to encodings and formalizations.  Specifically, the folder contains:
* introductory thesis text
* a bibliography
* visual aids
* presentation materials
