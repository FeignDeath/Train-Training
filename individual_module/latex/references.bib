	abstract = {The Vehicle Scheduling Problem (VSP) consists in assigning a set of scheduled trips to a set of vehicles, satisfying a set of constraints and optimizing an objective function. A wide literature exists for the VSP, but usually not all the practical requirements of the real cases are taken into account. In the present paper a practical case is studied, and for it a traditional method is tailored and two innovative heuristics are developed. As the problem presents a multicriteria nature, each of the three algorithms adopts a different approach to multicriteria optimization. Scalarization of the different criteria is performed by the traditional algorithm. A lexicographic approach is followed by an algorithm based on logic programming. Finally, a Pareto optimization approach is implemented by a modified genetic algorithm. All the algorithms are tested on the real problem, and two of them produce interesting practical results.
Scope and purpose
This paper presents the practical experience with a real case of Vehicle Scheduling Problem (VSP). The VSP is a classical optimization problem which is faced in the operational planning of public transportation systems (see for instance Dantzig and Fulkerson. Naval Research Logistics Quarterly 1954;1:217--222). It consists in assigning a set of scheduled trips to a set of available vehicles, in such a way that each trip is associated to one vehicle and a cost function is minimized. For some versions of it, such as when all vehicles are equal and share the same depot, efficient algorithms exist (see for instance Bodin et al. Computers & Operations Research 1983;10:63--212, Carraresi and Gallo. European Journal of Operational Research 1984;16:139--151); nevertheless, real-life applications often turn out to be complex, due to the particular requirements which are present in practical situations, but are hard to be modeled. Practical requirements for this problem, usually not considered in the literature, include considering several criteria, producing different alternative solutions, and getting hints on how data could be modified to improve the effectiveness of the solutions. The paper analyzes the features of the real problem and discusses different algorithmic approaches for it. It has basically two purposes. The first is to analyze, formalize and comply with the experienced requirements of the practical problem. The second consists in assessing the applicability and performance of non-conventional heuristics and of a traditional exact method.},

@article{frhuje22a,
	abstract = {A railway company has to deal with many interrelated planning tasks. In this work we consider the Railway Crew Scheduling Problem (RCSP) for the Rail Cargo Austria (RCA), which is the largest railway company for freight transportation in Austria and one of the largest in Europe. The RCSP aims for determining the most efficient combination of shifts. For RCA's purposes these are shifts for engine drivers. A shift consists of a sequence of consecutive scheduled trips of locomotives and tasks over a given period of time. Each trip must be covered by exactly one shift while operational, legal and labor constraints are satisfied. The RCSP is known to be difficult to solve and there exists a wide range of solution approaches resulting from many research activities. We present and investigate a matheuristic to tackle the RCSP. We use a breadth-first search construction heuristic and formulate a Set Partitioning Problem with the aim of minimizing the overall paid working time, while all RCA specific constraints are incorporated. Although schedule efficiency and employee satisfaction are in general conflicting, a cost-efficient schedule will not be implemented if it does not reach acceptance of the crew. In a computational study we evaluate the proposed approach on it's practical applicability on real-world data provided by RCA, based on the Austrian railway network. The focus is on analyzing the effects of different conditions on crew schedules. In the course of this evaluation we make use of algorithms from previous work on the Locomotive Scheduling Problem (LSP), tailored to RCA's demands. The LSP is concerned with assigning locomotives to a train schedule while costs are minimized, and the obtained optimal locomotive schedule forms the input for the RCSP. This work provides the basis for a succeeding planning tool, as soon as the locomotive schedule was determined.},

@article{limibo07a,
	abstract = {Abstract When a vehicle on a scheduled trip breaks down, one or more vehicles need to be rescheduled to serve the customers on that trip with minimum operating and delay costs. The problem of reassigning vehicles in real-time to this cut trip as well as to other scheduled trips with given starting and ending times, is referred to as the vehicle rescheduling problem (VRSP). This paper considers modeling, algorithmic, and computational aspects of the single-depot VRSP. The paper formulates a model for this problem and develops several fast algorithms to solve it, including parallel synchronous auction algorithms. The concept of the common feasible network (CFN) is introduced to find a good set of initial ``prices'' for speeding up the auction algorithm. Computational experiments on randomly generated problems are described. Computational results show that, for small problems, all of the developed algorithms demonstrate very good computational performances. For large problems, parallel CFN-based auction algorithms provide the optimal solution with much smaller computation times. {\copyright} 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
