\section{What is this problem?}
\subsection{What is Flatland?}
The Flatland competition seeks to address the problem of automated train scheduling and rescheduling, a major challenge
for modern railway systems. It does so by providing a simplified two-dimensional grid world environment to allow for fast experimentation of new approaches to this problem \cite{monylascscbhwaegeibavistsasp20a}. 

\subsection{What work is similar to Flatland?}
In essence, the Flatland problem is a vehicle scheduling or vehicle rescheduling problem.  The vehicle scheduling problem (VSP) is [definition].   \\

The vehicle rescheduling problem (VSRP) arises when a previously-scheduled trip is disrupted due to interruptions such as a traffic collision, a medical emergency, or a vehicle breakdown \cite{limibo07a}.  Trips in the Flatland environment may be disrupted by randomly-assigned vehicle breakdowns, each of which stops a train in its current location for an unforeseen duration.  Ideally, scheduled trips that are affected by a breakdown should be rescheduled in such a way that there are minimal impacts to the original plan. \\

\subsection{What is multi-agent pathfinding?}
Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a planning problem in which agents in a shared environment must find routes to their respective destinations without incurring collisions \cite{silver05a}. \\
