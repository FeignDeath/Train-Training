# Individual Module

This is where I'll keep the important materials pertaining to my individual module.  Primarily, one can find:
* text for my future thesis [`main.tex`](https://github.com/krr-up/flatland/blob/murphy_dev/individual_module/main.tex)
* a bibliography [`references.bib`](https://github.com/krr-up/flatland/blob/murphy_dev/individual_module/references.bib)
* visual aids, including diagrams, images, and animations
* presentations
