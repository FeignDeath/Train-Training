have environment generator

someone else could make "new_generator" that either inherits from my generator or uses it as an API

1. inherit
2. use as API

re-read this: building your own ASP system

use the code to create a custom solution

danger that it adds but it could be future work â€” you could do it and keep it for PhD

when we talk about the design, we keep these options on the radar

ask Roland for help with this, to talk about software architecture -- bene can help as well

compile a to-do list in a file called "future work"

thesis
framework that supports solutions to Flatland problems
the framework is "it's not hard-wired, it's plug and play"
there are limits (no acceleration, etc)
here, the idea is to have generic problem representations
in thesis this is on the ASP level, in the future at the level of python

first priority should be to complete the thesis

you procrastinate in a productive way

rico
> make generator with ASP support


easy in acceptance 
thesis - you just have to find people, and acceptance from exam board



what's expected for thesis ---
framework
idea is you can do flatland with different "approaches" alternative encodings, etc.
demonstrate that it's general, you have two different ways to solve it.
then you can plug and play, afterward evaluate them


keep a good note about what we want 



phd
you need a solid workbench - my master's thesis
work on approaches, scalability

large neighborhood search -- look into this later (the technique is not fancy, but we need it in our tool belt)
