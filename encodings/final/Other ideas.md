### Python libraries
> Basic libraries for functions such as saving files, parsing strings, processing data structures, and supporting command line argument inputs.


### Flatland libraries
> Only the Flatland libraries that handle environment creation and rendering are needed.

### Command line inputs
> The user can specify the parameters of the environments to be made, as well as the number of environments to be made in batch

### Custom functions
> The custom functions play a large role. 

### Main program



# Notes for the thesis
something I may want to talk about it what alternatives would exist for representing the environmentâ€”graph, hypergraph

in my exemplar, it retains the grid and assigns each cell to its underlying Flatland ID which encodes information about the type and rotation, all of which enables the program to determine legal transitions

another thing is to say whether something is an optimal path finder (how does one actually prove this?)
